# Installation

For **vLLM 0.24 with ThunderAgent and V1 async**, follow the
[dedicated guide](THUNDERAGENT_VLLM024.md), which preserves the 0.24 engine stack
and includes the required compatibility patch.

## Source install

Use an activated **Python 3.12** environment on Linux with verl and either
**vLLM 0.28.0** or **SGLang 0.5.19** already installed. Keep separate environments
for the two engines. Install the Python build tools into that environment:

```bash
python3 -m pip install uv 'maturin[patchelf]'
```

Rust **1.96.1** is selected by the pinned checkout's `rust-toolchain.toml`.
For system libraries, the compiler and libclang, follow the
[official source-build guide](https://docs.dynamo.nvidia.com/dynamo/advanced-customizations/building-from-source).
Build in a Linux environment compatible with the training container.

```bash
export DYNAMO_SRC=/path/to/dynamo
cd "$DYNAMO_SRC"
git checkout 8c5a73723109058f96c15fff3fc912231d65ad6e
python3 -m uv build --wheel
cd "$DYNAMO_SRC/lib/bindings/python"
python3 -m maturin build --release --locked --features kv-indexer --out "$DYNAMO_SRC/dist"
python3 -m uv pip install --python "$(command -v python3)" \
    --reinstall-package ai-dynamo --reinstall-package ai-dynamo-runtime \
    "$DYNAMO_SRC"/dist/ai_dynamo*.whl 'protobuf>=6.33.5,<7'
export PYTHONPATH="$DYNAMO_SRC/components/src${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}"
python3 -c 'import dynamo._core; print(dynamo._core.__file__)'
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --help
```

`uv build` produces the `ai_dynamo` Python wheel; `maturin build` produces the
`ai_dynamo_runtime` wheel containing `dynamo._core`. Both go into `dist/` here;
keep only this build's two wheels there. The install command replaces those two
packages even if a previous build has the same version number, while resolving
Dynamo dependencies. `--python` selects the active interpreter explicitly.

`PYTHONPATH` loads frontend/backend Python code from the same checkout. Repeat
that export in the training job, with the checkout mounted at `DYNAMO_SRC`.
Keep `etcd` and `nats-server` on `PATH`, then use the [README launch commands](README.md#launch).

## Build features

`--features kv-indexer` keeps Cargo's default features and adds the standalone
indexer. This recipe's text-only frontend KV routing does not use the other
optional services in the full build. Enable routing at runtime with `router_mode=kv` and
`enable_kv_events=true`; the build flag alone does not configure the router.

The reduced feature selection is based on the pinned source and recipe's launch
path. Published benchmark results used the
[full build recorded with the benchmark](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-recipe/blob/5451026758c3f1dc3ebc2a46a0e52b14406f0f72/dynamo/INSTALL.md#dfw-benchmark-build);
the reduced build has not been rerun through the H100 comparison.
