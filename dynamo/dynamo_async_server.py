"""DynamoHttpServer + DynamoReplica.

Reference impl: nemo_rl/models/generation/dynamo/dynamo_generation.py.
  1. Reserves no GPUs itself; trainer workers in colocated mode already claim
     them. We only forward CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES into the engine subprocesses.
  2. Spawns + watchdogs etcd / nats-server / dynamo.{vllm,sglang} × N /
     dynamo.frontend. Which engine is picked is documented at ENGINE_VLLM below.
  3. Never holds an in-process engine (no AsyncLLM, no sglang Engine). The
     actor's generate() method is only an HTTP client shim to dynamo.frontend;
     it does not generate locally.

            utilization and must be in ``[0.0, 1.0]`` (the frontend rejects
            out-of-range values); pass the literal ``"None"`` to disable the
            check. The prefill thresholds likewise accept ``"None"`` to disable.
            We default all three to disabled so the KV router routes purely by
            cache affinity instead of shedding load — the original intent behind
            the previous (now out-of-range) ``1000.0`` sentinels.
          * ``--router-predict-on-route`` (boolean) was removed in v1.2.0 and
            replaced in v1.3.0 (the version installed here) by
            ``--router-predicted-ttl-secs <ttl>``. We enable route-time

            (bool, default true) and ``router_predicted_ttl_secs`` (default
            120.0; set to None/0 to disable).

        Legacy configs in this repo documented the pre-v1.2.0 "disable" sentinels
        (e.g. ``active_decode_blocks_threshold: 1000.0``). Those are out of v1.2.0's
        valid range and would now make the frontend exit before healthcheck, so we

        frontend pins every request carrying the same ``x-dynamo-session-id`` to
        the worker that served the first one, for TTL seconds after the last hit.
        For verl that key is the trajectory's request_id (see _frontend_headers),
        so the later turns of a multi-turn rollout land on the worker that already
        holds their prefix regardless of what the KV index knows -- the index only
        learns about blocks from KV events (see enable_kv_events) and from
        predict-on-route entries that expire after router_predicted_ttl_secs.
        The frontend accepts 1..=31_536_000 (dynamo router_args.py); reject other
        values here so a typo fails at config time, not as a frontend that never
        turns healthy.
